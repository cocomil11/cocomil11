Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by [Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org).

My research lies at the intersection of Data Visualization, Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), and Human-Computer Interaction. I’m particularly interested in using AR/VR as a medium for data visualization, with the goal of enabling more effective data exploration and communication. My work has been presented at leading conferences such as AAAI, CHI, ACM Multimedia, and IEEE VIS.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked in Tokyo as a data scientist, supporting data analysis across various industries at both a leading consulting firm and a startup. I built and deployed end-to-end systems for demand forecasting and causal inference, and also provided corporate training and online courses on data analysis. I’m also passionate about using ICT for humanitarian purposes and actively engage in pro bono projects that aim to create social impact.
